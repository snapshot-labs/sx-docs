# API

The [API](https://github.com/snapshot-labs/sx-api) indexes Snapshot X data. Specifically, it monitors events emitted by spaces and space factories so that votes, proposals, and the deployment of new spaces can be tracked. Anyone can run the API, it use [Checkpoint](https://github.com/snapshot-labs/checkpoint) a solution to build an API from StarkNet on-chain data, largely inspired by TheGraph.
